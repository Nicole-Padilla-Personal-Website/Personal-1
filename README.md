# Personal Website Project 

For this project I have used concepts we have been learning in the Grace Hopper Program to create my first Portfolio. I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the creation of this project. 

## Table of Contents

1 - index.html: Home Page - Main page and a brief introduction
2 - about.html: About Page - Information about me and what I enjoy
3 - portfolio.html: Portfolio Page - All the projects I have worked on
4 - style.css: CSS file with all the styling I have used throughout the website
